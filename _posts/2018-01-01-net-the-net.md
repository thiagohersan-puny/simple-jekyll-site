**Private network as frame for artistic interventions**  
Through the description and analysis of the creative process of network-based artworks, the paper addresses the micropolitical attitude of artists while framing reality through their private circle. The analysed artworks comprehend from the authorsâ€™ own repertoire XOXOXOLOLOLOL(2015-17) and Zusammen(2017).

By means of circular and self-organizing regulation these works explore cybernetic principles while turning tangible the resonance of thought and preparing the terrain for self-understanding and self-criticism among the participants.

The methodology combines a historical and analytical approach, through New Materialism, Media Archaeology, Cultural Techniques and Second-order Cybernetics. Besides criticizing established conceptions and models of social media and traditions, the discussion envisions the acknowledgement of the role of affection in the joy of acting and understanding, which is potentialized in the context of shared experiences.

Furthermore, cybernetic principles behind the creative processes and aesthetic experiences rendered by these performative artworks reveal an approach of how the interplay between materials and symbols organize the frame through which meaningful shared experiences might happen, towards knowledge construction.
